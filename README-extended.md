# Generative AI Architecture Patterns Documentation

This repository contains a Hugo-based static website that documents architecture patterns for Generative AI systems.

## About This Project

This documentation site provides developers and architects with practical patterns and best practices for implementing Generative AI solutions. The patterns are organized into categories covering various aspects of AI system design and implementation.

## Pattern Categories

The documentation covers the following categories:

1. **Foundation Models**: Patterns for selecting, fine-tuning, and deploying large language models and other foundation models
2. **Integration Patterns**: Ways to connect AI capabilities with existing systems and workflows
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Patterns for designing robust prompting systems
4. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Approaches for enhancing AI outputs with retrieval from knowledge bases
5. **Orchestration Patterns**: Ways to coordinate multiple AI and traditional components
6. **Evaluation and Feedback**: Patterns for testing, monitoring, and improving AI systems
7. **Responsible AI**: Patterns for implementing safety, security, and ethical considerations
