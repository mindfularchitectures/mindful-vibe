# Foundation Model Patterns

Foundation models form the basis of many generative AI systems. This section covers patterns related to selecting, using, and deploying foundation models in production.

## What are Foundation Models?

Foundation models are large AI models pre-trained on vast amounts of data that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. Examples include:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and Mistral
- Multimodal models like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney
- Audio models like Whisper
