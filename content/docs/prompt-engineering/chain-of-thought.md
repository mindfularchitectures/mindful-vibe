# Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that guides language models to break down complex reasoning into explicit, intermediate steps, resulting in more accurate responses to questions requiring multi-step reasoning.

## When to Use It

- When solving problems requiring logical reasoning
- For mathematical calculations
- When complex decision-making is needed
- For tasks requiring step-by-step analysis

## Implementation Approach

### Basic Structure:
```
[Question that requires reasoning]
Let's think through this step by step:
```

### Example:

**Without Chain-of-Thought:**
```
Q: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, then buys 3 more but uses 4 to make a pie, how many apples does John have left?
A: 2 apples
```

**With Chain-of-Thought:**
```
Q: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, then buys 3 more but uses 4 to make a pie, how many apples does John have left?
A: Let's think through this step by step:
1. John starts with 5 apples
2. John gives 2 apples to Mary, leaving him with 5 - 2 = 3 apples
3. John buys 3 more apples, so now he has 3 + 3 = 6 apples
4. John uses 4 apples to make a pie, leaving him with 6 - 4 = 2 apples
Therefore, John has 2 apples left.
```

## Benefits

- **Improved Accuracy**: Breaking down complex problems leads to fewer reasoning errors
- **Transparency**: The reasoning process is visible and can be checked
- **Adaptability**: Works across different types of reasoning tasks
- **Reduced "Hallucinations"**: The structured approach minimizes incorrect logical leaps

## Advanced Techniques

### Self-Consistency with CoT
Generate multiple reasoning paths and take the majority answer for even higher accuracy.

### Zero-shot CoT
Simply adding "Let's think step by step" to prompts often triggers chain-of-thought reasoning even without examples.

### Least-to-Most Prompting
Break complex problems into easier subproblems and solve them sequentially.

## Best Practices

1. Be explicit about requesting step-by-step reasoning
2. For complex problems, consider providing an example of the reasoning process
3. Encourage the model to evaluate its own reasoning as a final step
4. Use clear formatting to separate steps (numbering or bullet points)
